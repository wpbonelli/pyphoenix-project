    description: keyword to indicate that compressible storage is only calculated
      for a convertible cell (ICONVERT>0) when the cell is under confined conditions
      (head greater than or equal to the top of the cell). This option has no effect
      on cells that are marked as being always confined (ICONVERT=0).  This option
      is identical to the approach used to calculate storage changes under confined
      conditions in MODFLOW-2005.
