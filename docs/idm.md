# Input Data Model

MODFLOW 6 accepts input via **input files**. Each MODFLOW 6 input file corresponds to a **simulation**, a **model**, or a **package**. A package can be associated with a simulation, a model, or another package (in the latter case the package is called a **subpackage**). Each MODFLOW 6 input file contains one or more **blocks**. A block contains zero or more **parameters**. A parameter can be a **scalar**, **array**, or **list**.

This 10k-foot view in mind, the rest of this document describes the MODFLOW 6 input data model and the corresponding FloPy interface layer from the bottom up.

## Parameters

MODFLOW 6 accepts three kinds of parameters:

- scalars
- arrays
- lists (tables)

The `MFParameter` class is the parent of all parameter classes.

**Properties**

- `value`

**Instance Methods**

- `write()`

**Class Methods**

- `load()`

### Scalars

MODFLOW 6 accepts scalar inputs of several kinds:

- keywords
- integers
- reals
- paths

The `MFScalar` abstract class is the parent of all scalar parameter classes.

#### Keywords

The `MFKeyword` class represents boolean switches.

#### Integers

The `MFInteger` class represents integer parameters.

#### Reals

The `MFDouble` class represents real parameters.

#### Paths

The `MFFilename` class represents external file paths.

#### Repeating scalars

todo

#### Records

todo

### Arrays

MODFLOW 6 accepts 1D, 2D, and 3D input arrays.

The `MFArray` class represents input arrays.
The array is stored as a flat NumPy `ndarray` 
until written or viewed/returned. The class
emulates `ndarray` and works with standard
NumPy functions.

**Properties**

- `control_line`: returns the control line
- `value`: returns a copy of the `ndarray` in the proper shape
- `raw`: returns a copy of the array in the proper shape, without the scale factor applied
- `how`: identifies the array's input format
- `factor`: return the scale factor value

**Instance Methods**

- `__getitem__()`: slice the array
- `__setitem__()`: set/update the array
- `__str__()`: brief summary of array: control line
- `__repr__()`: array as will be written to input file
  - control line for external/constant
  - control line + data lines for internal
- `write()`: write the array to file

**Class Methods**

- `load()`: load the array from file

### Lists

MODFLOW 6 accepts lists of space-delimited input records.

The `MFList` class represents list (tabular) data, e.g. stress
period data. The class handles reading, dynamic dtype handling
and dtype expansion for boundnames and auxvars.

**Properties**

- `value`: return a copy of the underlying `DataFrame`

**Instance Methods**

- `__getitem__()`: get a column, dict syntax
- `__setitem__()`: set a column, dict syntax
- `__getattr__()`: get a column, attr syntax
- `__setattr__()`: set a column, attr syntax
- `__str__()`: brief summary of list
- `__repr__()`: list as will be written to input file
- `write()`: write the list to file

**Class Methods**

- `load()`: load the list from file

## Blocks

A block is a collection of parameters in a MODFLOW 6 input file. A block is delimited by lines containing `BEGIN <block name>` and `END <block name>`.

A block contains zero or more parameters. If a block contains a list, the list must be the block's only parameter. Parameters are identified by keywords or indices &mdash; scalars and arrays are identified by keyword, lists by the index of the block. A block index is an integer appended to the block's name.

The `MFBlock` class represents an input block.

**Properties**

- `name`: block name
- `index`: only set if period block
- `type`: options, dimensions, package data

**Instance Methods**

- `__getitem__()`: get a param, dict syntax
- `__setitem__()`: set a param, dict syntax
- `__getattr__()`: get a param, attr syntax
- `__setattr__()`: set a param, attr syntax
- `__str__()`: brief summary of block
- `__repr__()`: block as will be written to input file
- `write()`: write the list to file

**Class Methods**

- `load()`: load the list from file

## Packages

A package configures either a model or a simulation. A package input file contains one or more related blocks.

The `MFPackage` class represents a MODFLOW 6 package. The class reads/writes package input files, delegating to constituent blocks.

**Properties**

- `options`: options block (always)
- `periods`: period blocks (only if relevant to package)
- `package`: 

**Methods**

## Models

A model is a physical process included in a simulation. A model is associated with a namefile and a number of package input files.

The `MFModel` class represents a MODFLOW 6 model. The class reads/writes model name files and delegates reading/writing of package input files to constituent packages.

## Simulations

A simulation is MODFLOW 6's main entry point. A simulation contains one or more models. A simulation is associated a namefile and a number of model and package input files.

The `MFSimulation` class represents a MODFLOW 6 simulation. The class reads/writes simulation name files and delegates reading/writing of model and package input files to constituent models and packages.
